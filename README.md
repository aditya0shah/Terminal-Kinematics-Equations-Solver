# Terminal-Kinematics-Equations-Solver

This Python program will solve kinematic equations after entering certain variables. 

Works for TI 84 Plus CE Python Calculators!

Program will prompt you for *missing variable* and *solving for* value. *Missing value* is the variable in your equation which is not given nor you are solving for. *Solving for* value is the variable that you would like this program to solve for.

Then the program will prompt you with the values for some other variables where it will then output correct value for the *solving for* variable!
